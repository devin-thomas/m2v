This is a quick program designed to accept an input jpg or png image file, an mp3 or wav audio file, then output an mp4 file with the image overlaid on top of it. 

In the source, I have codec set to 'hevc_nvenc' but you can change it to "libx264" or the codec you prefer if you don't have an NVIDIA GPU.
